Scrapping a little website in Golang in two parts: dl &amp; rename files and parse data &amp; add to db

This project is able to get all calling prefixes by country and by city, parse it to get only accurate data and add it to a database.
The project is functionnal but not finished yet, I need to make a fusion of the two parts later.
